# Factorial Calculator in Erlang

## Project Description
This project demonstrates the use of functional programming principles in Erlang by implementing a recursive factorial calculator. The program showcases recursion, pattern matching, guards, and list manipulation.

## Project Goals
- Develop an Erlang module to calculate factorials using recursion.
- Explore pattern matching and guard clauses.
- Integrate list operations and lambda functions for additional functionality.

## Instructions for Build and Use

### Steps to build and/or run the software:
1. Install Erlang and ensure `erl` is in your system path.
2. Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Compile the module:
   ```bash
   erl
   c(factorial_calculator).
Run the program:
erlang
Copy code
factorial_calculator:factorial(5).
Instructions for using the software:
Call the factorial/1 function with a non-negative integer.
Observe the output, which is the factorial of the given number.
Development Environment
To recreate the development environment, install the following:

Erlang/OTP 25.0 or later.
Visual Studio Code with the Erlang plugin (optional).
